Download the https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/neo4j-docker.zip[neo4j-docker.zip file] and unzip it to a folder that will be used for saving Neo4j configuration changes for clusters. This will be your working directory for the Causal Clustering Exercises in this training. *Hint*: curl -O https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.neo4j.com/admin-neo4j/neo4j-docker.zip
. Download the Docker image for Neo4j (*docker pull neo4j:3.5.0-enterprise*).
