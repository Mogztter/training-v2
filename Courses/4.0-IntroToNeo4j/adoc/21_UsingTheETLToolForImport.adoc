== About this module

You have learned many of the ways that you can import data into a graph using Cypher, APOC, the neo4j-admin tool, and by writing an application that connects to the RDBMS to extract data and add it to the graph.

Another way that you can import data into the graph is by using the Neo4j ETL Tool which you will learn about next.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

[square]
* Install the Neo4j ETL Tool in your development environment.
* Use the Neo4j ETL Tool to import data.


== What is the Neo4j ETL Tool?

The Neo4j ETL Tool is a graph application that is available from Neo4j Desktop, or you can download it from https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-etl/[Github].
You use it to connect to an RDBMS, view the data, model the data for a graph, and then import the data into the graph.

It can be used via the command-line, but must developers new to Neo4j will use the UI for the viewing, mapping, and importing.

Some of the features of this tool include:

[square]

* Manage multiple database connections.
* Extract database metadata from the DBMS.
* Derive a graph data model from the relational model.
* Visually edit labels, relationship types, property names, and property types.
* Visualize the current model as a graph.
* Retrieve relevant CSV data from the DBMS.
* Import data into the graph using multiple environments:
** neo4j-import
** cypher-shell
** java bolt connection
* Supports multiple external database connections including:
** Oracle
** MS SQLServer
** IBM DB2
** Derby
** Cassandra
** SAP Hana
** MySQL
** PostgresSQL

In this lesson, you will learn the basics of using the Neo4j ETL Tool. You should review the documentation for more details for your particular use cases.

== Installing the Neo4j ETL Tool for use in your project

Neo4j Desktop v1.2.4 or later comes with Neo4j ETL tool already available to you:

To add the tool for use in your project, you simply click *Add Application* and select it for your project:

image::{imagedir}/InstallETLTool1.png[InstallETLTool1,width=1000,align=center]

And here we see that it is now available in our TestETLTool project:

image::{imagedir}/InstallETLTool2.png[InstallETLTool2,width=1000,align=center]

== Using the Neo4j ETL Tool for import

For a simple import of data into your graph, you follow these steps:

. Start the Neo4j ETL Tool.
. Select the target database (graph) that you will import into.
. Set up a database connection for the source database.
. Choose the source database (from the step above) to import from and the Neo4j database to import to.
. Create the mapping from the source database to the graph data model.
. Import the data.

=== Starting the Neo4j ETL Tool

After you have added the Neo4j ETL Tool to your Neo4j Desktop project, you simply click the tool to start it.
A new window opens and a dialog will appear asking if it is OK to run background processes.
You should agree to continue:

Here is the starting window for the Neo4j ETL Tool:

image::{imagedir}/ETLToolStarted.png[ETLToolStarted,width=1000,align=center]

=== Selecting the target database

In the Neo4j Desktop project where you have installed Neo4j ETL Tool, you must select the database you will use as the target database.

Here we select the TestETLTool project and we see that there is one database that is running. If you had multiple graphs for the project, you would select the graph that you want to use.
To use the Neo4j ETL Tool, the database must be started (running).
In this example, we select the database that is running.

image::{imagedir}/ETLToolSelectTarget.png[ETLToolSelectTarget,width=1000,align=center]

=== Set up connection to the source database

Next, you must connect to the source database so you click *Add Connection*:

image::{imagedir}/ETLToolClickAddConnection.png[ETLToolClickAddConnection,width=1000,align=center]

The JDBC Connection window opens. You must enter information about the source database:

In the JDBC Connection page, you must:

. Enter the name of the connection.
. Enter the URL of the host, or localhost if the database is running locally.
. The port number used for the jdbc connection (default is 5432).
. Select the type of DBMS (default is postgresql).
. Enter the name of the database.

The schema information is automatically populated for you.

[start=6]
. The user name and password for accessing the database.

In this example, we show the settings for this lesson, which is a PostgresSQL server running that hosts the northwind database:

image::{imagedir}/ETLJDBCConnection.png[ETLJDBCConnection,width=1000,align=center]

Finally, you should click *Test and Save Connection* to ensure that you can connect to the source database.



neo4j-java-driver-4.0.0.jar must be placed in the lib folder for your project.

npm i neo4j-driver  (for the Javascript driver)

db-examples.cmlvojdj5cci.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com

n4examples
36gdOVABr3Ex

== *Exercise 20: Importing data from an RDBMS*

In this exercise, you will use groovy to run a Java application that uses the JDBC connection to the northwind database to read data and then create nodes in your Neo4j database.

*Exercise steps:*

// NOTE: Make sure these "if you have not done so already" are part of course setup instructions

. If you have not done so already, install sdk on  your system:
.. curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
.. source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
.. Verify the installation:
... sdk help
. If you have not done so already, install groovy:
.. sdk install groovy
. Ensure the Neo4j database server is started.
. Connect to the database with Neo4j Browser.
. Create a new database named _products_.
. Create or modify the *rdbms2graph.groovy* file to use the credentials for accessing your database (typically the password is different).
. In the directory where you have placed groovy rdbms2graph.groovy, run it:
.. groovy rdbms2graph.groovy
. Confirm in Neo4j Browser that the product nodes have been created in the products graph.
