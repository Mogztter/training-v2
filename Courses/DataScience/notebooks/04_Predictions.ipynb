Once you have computed scores with this algorithms what should you do?\n\nThere are two main approaches that one can take:\n\n## Using the measures directly\n\nYou can use the scores from the link predictions directly, specifying a __threshold value__ above which we predict that a link will be created between two nodes.\n\n## Supervised learning\n\nYou can take a supervised learning approach where you use the scores as features to train a binary classifier. The binary classifier then predicts whether a pair of nodes will have a link.\n\nIn this notebook you will apply the supervised learning approach.\n\n## Train and test datasets \n\nNext, you must create the train and test datasets on which you can build, and then evaluate a model.\n\n## Positive examples\n\nThe tricky thing when working with graph data is that you cannot just randomly split the data, as this could lead to data leakage.\n\nData leakage can occur when data outside of your training data is inadvertently used to create your model. This can easily happen when working with graphs because pairs of nodes in the training set may be connected to those in the test set.\n\nWhen you compute link prediction measures over that training set the __measures computed contain information from the test set__ that you will later evaluate the model against.\n\nInstead, you need to split the graph into training and test sub graphs. If the graph has a concept of time, things are easier as you can split the graph at a point in time. The training set will be from before the time, the test set after.\n\nThis is still not a perfect solution and you must ensure that the general network structure in the training and test sub graphs is similar.\n\nSubsequently, pairs of nodes in our train and test datasets will have relationships between them. They will be the __positive examples__ in your machine learning model.\n\nBecause the citation graph contains times, you can create train and test graphs by splitting the data on a particular year. Next, you must determine what year that should be. Determine the distribution of the first year that co-authors collaborated:"

An approach described in several link prediction papers is to use pairs of nodes that are a __specific number of hops away from each other__.\n\nThis will significantly reduce the number of negative examples, although there will still be a lot more negative examples than positive.\n\nTo solve this problem, you either need to down sample the negative examples or up sample the positive examples.\n\nYou will take the down sampling approach.
