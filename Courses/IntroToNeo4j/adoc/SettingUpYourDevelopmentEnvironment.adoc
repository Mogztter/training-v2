== Preparing for the course

You must prepare your development environment before you take any of the following courses:

* *Introduction to Neo4j*
* *Graph Data Modeling for Neo4j*
* *Advanced Cypher*

You should bring a laptop to the class that will enable you to access the Internet wirelelessly.
In preparation for the course, you must download and install Neo4j Desktop, create a graph (database), and use Neo4j Browser to load movie data into the database.

The Neo4j Desktop includes the Neo4j Database server which includes the graph engine and kernel so that Cypher statements can be executed to access a database on your system. 
It includes an application called  Neo4j Browser.  
Neo4j Browser enables you to access a Neo4j database using Cypher. 
You can also call built-in procedures that communicate with the database server. 
There are a number of additional libraries and drivers for accessing the Neo4j database from Cypher or from another programming language that you can install in your development environment.

Neo4j Desktop runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

== Steps for setting up your development environment for this course

Here is an overview of the steps you will perform to set up your development environment:

. *Getting Started with Neo4j Desktop*:
.. Download Neo4j Desktop.
... View/save the installation instructions.
.. Install Neo4j Desktop.
.. In a project, create a local graph (database) you will use for this course.
.. Start the graph.
. *Getting started with Neo4j Browser*:
.. Click the Neo4j Browser application.
.. Load the movie data into the graph.

Follow along with one of these videos to download, install and get started using Neo4j Desktop. You will create a graph (database) that you will start. This is the graph that  you will later load with the movie data.

*Note*: Before you install on Windows, make sure you have the latest version of PowerShell installed.

== Using Neo4j Browser

Neo4j Browser is a tool that enables you to access a Neo4j Database by executing Cypher statements to create or update data in the graph and to query the graph to return data. 
The data returned is typically visualized as nodes and relationships in a graph, but can also be displayed as tables. 
In addition to executing Cypher statements, you can execute a number of system calls that are related to the database being accessed by the Browser. 
For example, you can retrieve the list of queries that are currently running in the server.

There are two ways that you can use Neo4j Browser functionality:
[square]
* Open the Neo4j Browser application from Neo4j Desktop (database is local)
* Use the Neo4j Browser Web interface by specifying a URL in a Web browser using port 7474 (database is local)

The user interface and behavior for the Neo4j Browser application and Neo4j Browser Web interface is identical, except that in the Web interface, you have the option of syncing your settings and scripts to the cloud.

Follow along with this video to become familiar with common tasks in Neo4j Browser and populate the graph that is used for training with the movie data.

*Note*: Before you perform the tasks shown in this video, you must have created and started the database in Neo4j Desktop.

=== *Important: Confirm your development environment is properly set up*

In Neo4j Browser where you are connected to the database and have loaded the movie data.

Execute this Cypher statement:

[source,cypher-syntax]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)
----

If this query returns *171*, then your database has been set up properly and you are ready to start the training.
