== Preparing for the course

You must prepare your development environment before you take this training session, Graph Algorithms for Data Science.

To prepare for this course, you must do the following before this session (scroll down for detailed instructions):

. Ensure that you have the latest Neo4j Desktop (1.2.9 or later) installed on your laptop.
. Create the project and database for this training.
. Install plugins for the database.
. Download the PaySim fraud dataset.
. Modify the Neo4j configuration.
. Start the fraud database.
. Verify your setup.

== Step 1: Install latest version of Neo4j Desktop

If you do not have Neo4j Desktop installed, https://neo4j.com/download-center/#desktop[download] version 1.2.9 or later and install it.

If you already have Neo4j Desktop installed, but is is not up to version 1.2.9 or later, upgrade by selecting *Neo4j Desktop -> Check for updates*.

=== Getting started with Neo4j Browser

If you have never used Neo4j Browser, you can watch this video that illustrates the basics of using Neo4j Browser.

== Step 2: Create the project and database for this training

. In Neo4j Desktop, create a new project named *Fraud*

[start=2]
. In this new project, create a graph of version 3.5.18. Don't forget to type a password for this database.

== Step 3: Install plugins for this database

For this training, you will use the GDS and APOC plugins. You should NOT install the Graph Algorithms plugin!

. Go to the Manage area for the Fraud database you just created:

[start=2]
. Install the GDS and APOC plugins. (Do NOT install the Graph Algorithms plugin)

Here is what you should see after installation:

== Step 4: Download the PaySim dataset and install it as your database.

. Download the zip file:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/neo4j-ps-ds-bootcamp/data/paysim.zip
. For database you created earlier, open a terminal window:

[start=3]
. In the terminal window:
.. Change to the *data/databases* directory.
.. Copy the zip file  you just downloaded to the current directory.
.. Unzip the zip file.
.. Remove the zip file.

You should now have a graph.db file in the data/databases directory:

== Step 5: Modify the Neo4j Configuration

. In the Manage area for the database, click the *Settings* tab.
. Modify the default initial heap size, max heap size, and page cache memory configuration as follows:
.. dbms.memory.heap.initial_size=2G
.. dbms.memory.heap.max_size=2G
.. dbms.memory.pagecache.size=2G
. Click *Apply* to save your changes.

== Step 6: Start the fraud database

Back in the Project view, start the database:

image:{imagedir2}/StartFraudDB.png[StartFraudDB,width=600]

== Step 7: Verify your setup

. After the database starts, you should see 1,663,200 nodes and 3,271,992 relationships in the database.
. Open Neo4j Browser for the started fraud database.
. Enter these statements:
.. RETURN gds.version();
.. RETURN apoc.version();

*Congratulations!* You are now ready to perform the exercises for this training session.
