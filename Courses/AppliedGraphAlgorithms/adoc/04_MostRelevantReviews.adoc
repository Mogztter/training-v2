_Most relevant reviews exercise solution_

[#module-3.quiz]
== Check your understanding
=== Question 1

==== Algorithm Understanding: Personalized PR

Which of the following best describe the Personalized PageRank algorithm?

Select the correct answer.
[%interactive]
- [ ] [.false-answer]#It measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects.#
- [ ] [.required-answer]#It's a variation of the PageRank algorithm that is biased towards a set of source nodes#
- [ ] [.false-answer]#It computes the influence of a node by measuring the number of the immediate neighbors and also all other nodes in the network that connect to the node under consideration through these immediate neighbors#
- [ ] [.false-answer]#It's a variation of the PageRank algorithm that reduces the bias that PageRank has towards assigning higher scores to nodes with relationships from nodes that have few outgoing relationships.#

== Question 2
==== Running the algorithm in Neo4j

What is the default value of the `dampingFactor` used by the PageRank procedure?

Select the correct answer.
[%interactive]
- [ ] [.false-answer]#0.15#
- [ ] [.required-answer]#0.85#
- [ ] [.false-answer]#0.70#
- [ ] [.false-answer]#0.12#

== Summary
