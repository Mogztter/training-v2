== Using the Graph Data Science (GDS) Library & PaySim Dataset For Fraud Detection.

This browser guide is walking you through a step by step hands-on exercise, using the GDS Library to detect first and second party fraud with the PaySim dataset.

The modules included in this guide are the following:

. Framing the problem
. Data Understanding
. First-party Fraud Detection
. Second-party Fraud Detection

== Module 1: Framing the Problem

=== *What is Fraud?*

*Fraud occurs* when an individual or group of individuals, or a business entity *intentionally*
deceives another individual or business entity with *misrepresentation* of identity, products,
services, or financial transactions and/or *false promises* with no intention of fulfilling them.

{nbsp} + 

=== *Fraud Categories*

* *First-party Fraud*
** An individual, or group of individuals, misrepresent their identity or give false information when applying for a product or services to receive more favourable rates or when have no intention of repayment.

* *Second-party Fraud*
** An individual knowingly gives their identity or personal information to another individual to commit fraud or someone is perpetrating fraud in his behalf.

* *Third-party Fraud*
** An individual, or group of individuals, create or use another person's identity, or personal details, to open or takeover an account.

== End of Module 1
In this module we framed the problem by defining Fraud and understanding the different fraud categories.
