== Exercise 15: Managing indexes (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 175 nodes and 257 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 15: Managing indexes (Overview)

In this exercise you write Cypher statements create, view, and drop indexes.

. In Part 1, you create an index.
. In Part 2, you view index information.
. In Part 3, you drop an index.

Go to the next page to perform the three parts of this exercise.

== Instructions, Exercise 15, Part 1
.*Creating an index*

Write the Cypher statement to create a single-property index on the _born_ property of a _Person_ node.

== Solution, Exercise 15, Part 1
.*Creating an index*

Write the Cypher statement to create a single-property index on the _born_ property of a _Person_ node.

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(born)
----

The result should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

Next, Part 2

== Instructions, Exercise 15, Part 2
.*Viewing indexes*

Write the Cypher statement to view the indexes defined for the graph.
Do you see indexes that you did not create with the `CREATE INDEX` statement?

== Solution, Exercise 15, Part 2
.*Viewing indexes*

Write the Cypher statement to view the indexes defined for the graph.
Do you see indexes that you did not create with the `CREATE INDEX` statement? The other indexes have been created because you previously created a uniqueness constraint and a node key constraint, both of which create indexes. You will only be able to see the performance benefits of indexes with large graphs which is beyond the scope of this training.

CALL db.indexes()

The result returned should be:

Next, Part 3

== Instructions, Exercise 15, Part 3
.*Dropping an index*

Write Cypher code to drop the single-property index you just created for the _born_ property of the _Person_ nodes.

== Solution, Exercise 15, Part 3
.*Dropping an index*

Write Cypher code to drop the single-property index you just created for the _born_ property of the _Person_ nodes.

[source, cypher]
----
DROP INDEX ON :Person(born)
----

image::{guides}/img/DropIndex.png[DropIndex,width=300,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

== Exercise 15: Managing indexes (Summary)

In this exercise you wrote Cypher statements to create, view, and drop an index for the graph.
