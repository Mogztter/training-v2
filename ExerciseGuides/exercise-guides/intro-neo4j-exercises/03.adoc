== Exercise 3: Filtering queries using relationships

=== Preparations

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise Overview

In the previous exercise, you have filtered what nodes and properties are returned from a query based upon a value of a property for a node.

In this exercise, you will write queries that filter the nodes and property values that are returned based upon the relationships between nodes.
You will first use an anonymous node to specify a filter based upon a node's specific relationship to other nodes.
Then you will write a query that selects data based upon any relationship between nodes.
Next, you will write a Cypher query to return information about the relationships between nodes.
Finally, you will write a query to return property values for the relationships between nodes.

. In Part 1, you retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_.
. In Part 2, you retrieve all movies that are connected to the person, _Tom Hanks_.
. In Part 3, you retrieve information about the relationships _Tom Hanks_ had with the set of movies retrieved earlier.
. In Part 4, you retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.

Go to the next page to perform the four parts of this exercise.

== Instructions, Exercise 3, Part 1
.*Retrieving all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_*

Write and execute the following Cypher queries:

. Display the schema of the database.
You will use this information to help you specify relationships in your queries.
. Retrieve all people that have written the movie _Speed Racer_.

.*Taking it further (optional)*
** Retrieve all people who have written other movies.
** Retrieve people who have acted in a particular movie.
** Retrieve people who have directed a particular movie.

== Solution, Exercise 3, Part 1
.*Retrieving all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_*

Write and execute the following Cypher queries:

*1. Display the schema of the database.
You will use this information to help you specify relationships in your queries.* 

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.schema
----

image::{guides}/img/call_db.schema.png[call_db.schema,width=300,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*2. Retrieve all people that have written the movie _Speed Racer_.* 

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(:Movie {title: 'Speed Racer'}) RETURN p.name
----

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/SpeedRacerWriters.png[SpeedRacerWriters,width=400,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

Notice here that the :Movie node is an anonymous node because for the query, we do not need information about the Movie node.

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

Next, Part 2

== Instructions, Exercise 3, Part 2
.*Retrieving all movies connected with _Tom Hanks_*

In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve all movies that are connected to _Tom Hanks_.

*Hint:* _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships with a movie so you should not specify a relationship type in the query.

.*Taking it further (optional)*
** Retrieve all movies connected with another actor.
** Retrieve all people connected with a particular movie.

== Solution, Exercise 3, Part 2
.*Retrieving all movies connected with _Tom Hanks_*

*In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve all movies that are connected to _Tom Hanks_.*

*Hint:* _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships with a movie so you should not specify a relationship type in the query.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<--(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title
----

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/TomHanksMovies.png[TomHanksMovies,width=400,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

Notice that _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships to the movie, "That Thing You Do".
Also notice that we specify the named node (with a variable) first.
It is a best practice to put named nodes first in a query.

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

Next, Part 3

== Instructions, Exercise 3, Part 3
.*Retrieving relationship information about _Tom Hanks_*

Modify the query that you just executed to return the type information about the relationships between _Tom Hanks_ and the movies.

.*Taking it further (optional)*
** Retrieve the relationship information about a different actor.

== Solution, Exercise 3, Part 3
.*Retrieving relationship information about _Tom Hanks_*

*Modify the query that you just executed to return the type information about the relationships between _Tom Hanks_ and the movies.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[rel]-(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title, type(rel)
----

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/TomHanksRelationshipTypes.png[TomHanksRelationshipTypes,width=400,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

Next, Part 4

== Instructions, Exercise 3, Part 4
.*Retrieving information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ played*

As an actor, a _Person_ node in the database connects to a _Movie_ node using the _ACTED_IN_ relationship.
One of the properties of the _ACTED_IN_ relationship is _roles_.

Write and execute the Cypher query to retrieve all of the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.

.*Taking it further (optional)*
** Retrieve all roles for a different actor.
** Retrieve all roles played for a particular movie.

== Solution, Exercise 3, Part 4
.*Retrieving information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ played*

As an actor, a _Person_ node in the database connects to a _Movie_ node using the _ACTED_IN_ relationship.
One of the properties of the _ACTED_IN_ relationship is _roles_.

*Write and execute the Cypher query to retrieve all of the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[rel:ACTED_IN]-(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title, rel.roles
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise Summary

In this exercise, you wrote queries that filter the nodes and property values that are returned based upon the relationships between nodes.
You first used an anonymous node to specify a filter based upon a node's specific relationship to other nodes.
Then you wrote a query that selects data based upon any relationship between nodes.
Next, you wrote a Cypher query to return information about the relationships between nodes.
Finally, you wrote a query to return property values for the relationships between nodes.
