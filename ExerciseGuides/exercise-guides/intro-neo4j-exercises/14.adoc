== Exercise 14: Managing constraints and node keys

=== Preparations

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 173 nodes and 257 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise Overview

In this exercise you write Cypher statements to add constraints to the graph that ensure uniqueness and existence.

. In Part 1, you create a uniqueness constraint on a property for a node.
. In Part 2, you create an existence constraint on a node.
. In Part 3, you create an existence constraint on a relationship.
. In Part 4, you create a node key.
. In Part 5, you drop some constraints.

Go to the next page to perform the five parts of this exercise.

== Instructions, Exercise 14, Part 1
.*Creating uniqueness constraints on a property of a node*

Suppose we want to ensure that every _Person_ in the graph must have a unique name.

. Add the constraint to the _Person_ nodes in the graph.
. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add _Tom Hanks_ to the graph.
What happens when you run the code?

== Solution, Exercise 14, Part 1
.*Creating uniqueness constraints on a property of a node*

Suppose we want to ensure that every _Person_ in the graph must have a unique name.

*1. Add the constraint to the _Person_ nodes in the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT p.name IS UNIQUE
----

Where the result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*2. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add _Tom Hanks_ to the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'})
----

What happens when you execute the statement?

The result returned should look something like this:

Existence

Next, Part 2

== Instructions, Exercise 14, Part 2
.*Creating an existence constraint on a node.*

Suppose we want to ensure that every _Person_ in the graph has a _born_ property.

. Add the constraint to the _Person_ nodes in the graph.
What happens when you add the constraint?
. Update the existing _Person_ nodes so that you set the _born_ property to _0_ for any nodes that do not exist.
. Now add the constraint to the graph.
. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add _Sean Penn_ to the graph where you do not specify a value for _born_.
What happens when you execute the statement?

== Solution, Exercise 14, Part 2
.*Creating an existence constraint on a node.*

Suppose we want to ensure that every _Person_ node in the graph has a _born_ property.

*1. Add the constraint to the _Person_ nodes in the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT exists(p.born)
----

What happens when you add the constraint? This is what you should see.
This is because there are _Person_ nodes in the graph that do not have _born_ properties set.

*2. Update the existing _Person_ nodes so that you set the _born_ property to _0_ for any nodes that do not exist.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) 
WHERE NOT exists(p.born)
SET p.born = 0
----

The result returned should be:

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*3. Now add the constraint to the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Person) ASSERT exists(p.born)
----

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/AddBornExistsConstraint.png[AddBornExistsConstraint,width=300,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*4. Write and execute Cypher code to add _Sean Penn_ to the graph where you do not specify a value for _born_.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Person {name: 'Sean Penn'})
----

What happens when you execute the statement? The result returned should be:

Next, Part 3

== Instructions, Exercise 14, Part 3
.*Creating an existence constraint on a relationship.*

Suppose we want to ensure that every _ACTED_IN_ relationship must have a value for the _roles_ property.

. Add the constraint to the _ACTED_IN_ relationship in the graph.
. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add an _ACTED_IN_ relationship from the person, _Emil Eifrem_ to the movie, _Forrest Gump_ where the _roles_ property is not set.
What happens when you execute the statement?

== Solution, Exercise 14, Part 3
.*Creating an existence constraint on a relationship.*

Suppose we want to ensure that every  _ACTED_IN_ relationship must have a value for the _roles_ property.

*1. Add the constraint to the _ACTED_IN_ relationship in the graph.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON ()-[r:ACTED_IN]-() ASSERT exists(r.roles)
----

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/CreateRolesConstraintExists.png[CreateRolesConstraintExists,width=300,float="right"]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*2. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add an _ACTED_IN_ relationship from the person, _Emil Eifrem_ to the movie, _Forrest Gump_ where the _roles_ property is not set.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person), (m:Movie)
WHERE p.name = 'Emil Eifrem' AND
      m.title = 'Forrest Gump'
MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
----

What happens when you execute the statement? Here is what you should see:

Next, Part 4

== Instructions, Exercise 14, Part 4
.*Creating a node key.*

Suppose we want to ensure that the graph will never contain a movie with the same title and the same year.
For example, the movie studio decides to release a movie with the title, _Back to the Future_ in 2018.
There already is a movie in the graph with this title that was released in 1985.
We want to allow this.
To implement this type of constraint on the graph, you must add a constraint as a node key since it uses two properties of the node.

*Note:* If you have created a uniqueness constraint to the graph for the _title_ property (as shown in the module content), you must first drop the constraint as it no longer makes sense if we are to allow duplicate titles in the graph.
You must execute this code to drop the constraint if it exists:

[source, cypher]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE
----

. Add a node key to the graph that will ensure that the combined values of _title_ and _released_ are unique for all _Movie_ nodes.
. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add the movie, _Back to the Future_ with a _released_ value of 1985 and a _tagline_ value of _Our future._.
. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add the movie, _Back to the Future_ with a _released_ value of _2018_ and a _tagline_ value of _The future is ours._.
. Try adding the _2018_ movie again.
What happens when you attempt to add the movie?

== Solution, Exercise 14, Part 4
.*Creating a node key.*

Suppose we want to ensure that the graph will never contain a movie with the same title and the same year.
For example, the movie studio decides to release a movie with the title, _Back to the Future_ in 2018.
There already is a movie in the graph with this title that was released in 1985.

*Note:* If you have created a uniqueness constraint to the graph for the _title_ property (as shown in the module content), you must first drop the constraint as it no longer makes sense if we are to allow duplicate titles in the graph.
You must write and execute the statement to drop the constraint if it exists:

[source, cypher]
----
DROP CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT m.title IS UNIQUE
----

*1. Add a node key to the graph that will ensure that the combined values of _title_ and _released_ are unique for all _Movie_ nodes.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Movie) ASSERT (m.title, m.released) IS NODE KEY
----

[.thumb]

The result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

*2. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add the movie, _Back to the Future_ with a _released_ value of _1985_ and a _tagline_ value of _Our future._.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'Back to the Future', released: 1985, tagline: 'Our future.'})
----

++++

*3. Write and execute a Cypher statement to add the movie, _Back to the Future_ with a _released_ value of _2018_ and a _tagline_ value of _The future is ours._.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'Back to the Future', released: 2018, tagline: 'The future is ours.'})
----

++++

*4. Try adding the _2018_ movie again.*

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE (:Movie {title: 'Back to the Future', released: 2018, tagline: 'The future is ours.'})
----
What happens when you attempt to add the movie? The creation fails due to the node key constraint:
