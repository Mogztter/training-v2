== Exercise 4: Label Propagation (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:{guides}/img/database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Exercise 4: Label Propagation (Overview)

In the Connected components exercise, you used the `unionFind` algorithm to write partition information to each *Place* node.
This property was named *unionFind_partition*. In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Label Propagation algorithm using the European Roads dataset.
This algorithm enables you to determine discreet sets of nodes that form clusters based upon how they are connected, as well as the weight of the connections.

In this exercise, you will:

* *Exercise 4.1*: Add a partition property to each node using Label Propagation.
* *Exercise 4.2*: Verify the results of executing the algorithm.

== Exercise 4.1: Add a partition property to each node using Label Propagation. (Instructions)

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the *Place* nodes and the the *EROAD* relationship using these guidelines:

* The algorithm will perform 10 iterations.
* The analysis will be done using BOTH directions.
* The algorithm will write a property named *partition* to each node with the computed value.
* The weight property name is *weight*.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.labelPropagation`.

== Exercise 4.1: Add a partition property to each node using Label Propagation. (Solution)

Write Cypher code to perform the Label Propagation algorithm on the *Place* nodes and the the *EROAD* relationship using these guidelines:

* The algorithm will perform 10 iterations.
* The analysis will be done using BOTH directions.
* The algorithm will write a property named *partition* to each node with the computed value.
* The weight property name is *weight*.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.labelPropagation`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.labelPropagation("Place", "EROAD", { iterations: 10, direction: "BOTH", writeProperty: "partition", weightProperty: "weight" })
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Exercise 4.2: Verify the results of executing the algorithm. (Instructions)

Write a query to return all *partition* values in the graph containing *Place* nodes.
For each distinct partition value, return the list of places.

== Exercise 4.2: Verify the results of executing the algorithm. (Solution)

Write a query to return all *partition* values in the graph containing *Place* nodes.
For each distinct partition value, return the list of places.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (node:Place)
RETURN DISTINCT node.partition, collect(node.name) AS places
ORDER BY node.partition DESC
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Exercise 4: Taking it further

. Try using the stream version of the algorithm.
. Try different configuration values, for example number of iterations.

== Exercise 4: Label Propagation (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Label Propagation algorithm using the European Roads dataset.
This algorithm enables you to determine discreet sets of nodes that form clusters based upon how they are connected, as well as the weight of the connections.
