== Exercise 16: Importing data (Preparations)


Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 175 nodes and 257 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

image::{guides}/img/AfterExercise14.png[After exercise 14,200,200, role=left]

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you should do the following in Neo4j Browser to recreated the database (assuming you are using the _neo4j_ database):

[source, cypher]
----
:USE system
CREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE neo4j
:USE neo4j
----

Then,  use the script below to populate it, including the constraints added in the previous exercise:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/AfterExercise13.cypher[]
----

== Exercise 16: Importing data (Overview)

In this exercise you write Cypher statements to import data into your graph.

* *Exercise 16.1*: Write the Cypher statement to read the actor data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.2*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.3*: Load the data into your graph.
* *Exercise 16.4*: Write the Cypher statement to read the movie data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.5*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.6*: Load the data into your graph.
* *Exercise 16.7*: Write the Cypher statement to read the relationship data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.8*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.9*: Load the data into your graph.
