== Exercise 19: Importing data with an application (Preparations)


For this exercise, you will be creating a new database with the neo4j-admin tool.
Make sure that the database instance is running.

== Exercise 18: Importing data with the import command of neo4j-admin (Overview)

In this exercise you create a database from a set of CSV files.

* *Exercise 18.1*: Place the CSV files in the *import* folder.
* *Exercise 18.2*: Examine the CSV files.
* *Exercise 18.3*: Open a terminal window for the Neo4j instance.
* *Exercise 18.4*: Use the neo4j-admin tool to import the CSV files.
* *Exercise 18.5*: View the database after import.

== Exercise 18.1: Place the CSV files in the *import* folder (Instructions/Solution)

If you are using a sandbox or Neo4j Aura, you do not have access to the neo4j-admin tool so you can skip this exercise.

. You must have downloaded the following ZIP file containing the CSV files:

https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/data.neo4j.com/v4.0-intro-neo4j/crimes-dataset.zip

*Hint*: use `curl -O` or `wget`.

[start=2]
. In Neo4j Desktop for the project's database you are using, select *Manage > Open Folder*.
. Unzip the contents of the crimes-dataset.zip to the *import* folder. The *import* folder should contain six CSV files.

== Exercise 18.2: Examine the CSV files (Instructions/Solution)

In a text editor of your choice, examine the CSV files. Make sure you understand the headers and how they will be used for the import.

== Exercise 18.3: Open a terminal window for the Neo4j instance (Instructions/Solution)

In Neo4j Desktop for the project you are using do the following:
. For the project's database that should be running, select *Mange > Open Terminal*.
. Navigate to the *import* folder.

== Exercise 18.4: Use the neo4j-admin tool to import the CSV files (Instructions)

*In the terminal window you just opened, use neo4j-admin tool to import the CSV files using these guidelines:*

----
             --database crimes
             --nodes crimes_header.csv,crimes.csv
             --nodes beats.csv
             --nodes=PrimaryType=primaryTypes.csv
             --relationships crimesBeats.csv
             --relationships=PRIMARY_TYPE=crimesPrimaryTypes.csv
             --trim-strings=true
----

== Exercise 18.4: Use the neo4j-admin tool to import the CSV files (Solution)

*In the terminal window you just opened, use neo4j-admin tool to import the CSV files using these guidelines:*

----
             --database crimes
             --nodes crimes_header.csv,crimes.csv
             --nodes beats.csv
             --nodes=PrimaryType=primaryTypes.csv
             --relationships crimesBeats.csv
             --relationships=PRIMARY_TYPE=crimesPrimaryTypes.csv
             --trim-strings=true
----

This is what you should enter:

----
../bin/neo4j-admin import --database crimes --nodes crimes_header.csv,crimes.csv --nodes beats.csv --nodes=PrimaryType=primaryTypes.csv -
-relationships crimesBeats.csv --relationships=PRIMARY_TYPE=crimesPrimaryTypes.csv --trim-strings=true > import.out
----

Examine the contents of *import.out*.  Did it execute without error?

== Exercise 18.5: View the database after import (Instructions)

*The database files have been created, but you must use the system database to add the crimes data base to your environment.
Using the system domain, create the _crimes_ database and then view its nodes and relationships.*

== Exercise 18.5: Verify that you can access APOC procecdures (Solution)

*The database files have been created, but you must use the system database to add the crimes data base to your environment.
Using the system domain, create the _crimes_ database and then view its nodes and relationships.*

Enter the following in the query edit pane:

----
:use system
CREATE DATABASE crimes
:use crimes
----

The database informatiob should now look as follows:

== Exercise 18: Importing data with the import command of neo4j-admin (Summary)

In this exercise you executed Cypher statements to import data into your graph using the APOC library.
