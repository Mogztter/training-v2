== Exercise 10: Intermediate query processing (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 10: Intermediate query processing (Overview)

In the previous exercises, you have filtered your queries using the `WHERE` clause of a Cypher query.

In this exercise, you will write queries that do additional query processing.
First, you will write a query that retrieves data with optional results.
Finally, you will perform intermediate processing during the query using a `WITH` clause.

* *Exercise 10.1*: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query.
* *Exercise 10.2*: Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies.
* *Exercise 10.3*: Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors with other optional data.

== Exercise 10.1: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query (Instructions)

*Write a Cypher query to retrieve all people in the graph whose name begins with _Tom_ and optionally retrieve all people named _Tom_ who directed a movie.*

== Exercise 10.1: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query (Solution)

*Write a Cypher query to retrieve all people in the graph whose name begins with _Tom_ and optionally retrieve all people named _Tom_ who directed a movie.*

----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 10.2: Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies (Instructions)

Next, you will write queries that perform some intermediate processing using the `WITH` clause.

*Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies, returning the name of the actor, and the list of movies for that actor.*

== Exercise 10.2: Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies (Solution)

*Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies, returning the name of the actor, and the list of movies for that actor.*

MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH  a, count(a) AS numMovies, collect(m.title) AS movies
WHERE numMovies = 5
RETURN a.name, movies

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 10.3: Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors with other optional data (Instructions)

*Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors, and optionally the names of people who reviewed the movies.*

== Exercise 10.3: Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors with other optional data (Solution)

*Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors, and optionally the names of people who reviewed the movies.*

MATCH (m:Movie)
WITH m, size((:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)) AS directors
WHERE directors >= 2
OPTIONAL MATCH (p:Person)-[:REVIEWED]->(m)
RETURN  m.title, p.name

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 10: Intermediate query processing (Summary)

In this exercise, you wrote queries that do additional query processing.
First, you wrote a query that retrieves data with optional results.
Finally, you performed intermediate processing during the query using a `WITH` clause.
