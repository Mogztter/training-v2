Neo4j Training Courses

This repository will include newly-developed training courses which includes course content and browser guides. Course content will be the same for online courses and classroom courses with the exception that we produce slides and a book for the classroom version, where the online version is strictly html.

Virtually all course exercises will be done using browser guides.
